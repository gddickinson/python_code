# In our example, we have packed three labels into the parent widget "root". We used pack() without any options. So pack had to decide which way to arrange the labels. As you can see, it has chosen to place the label widgets on top of each other and centre them. Furthermore, we can see that each label has been given the size of the text. If you want to make the widgets as wide as the parent widget, you have to use the fill=X option: 
#==============================================================================

from Tkinter import *

root = Tk()

w = Label(root, text="Red Sun", bg="red", fg="white")
w.pack(fill=X)
w = Label(root, text="Green Grass", bg="green", fg="black")
w.pack(fill=X)
w = Label(root, text="Blue Sky", bg="blue", fg="white")
w.pack(fill=X)

mainloop()

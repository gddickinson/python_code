#==============================================================================
# There are applications where the user should have the possibility to select a colour. Tkinter provides a pop-up menu to choose a colour. To this purpose we have to import the tkColorChooser module and have to use the method askColor:
# result = tkColorChooser.askColor ( color, option=value, ...)
# If the user clicks the OK button on the pop-up window, respectively, the return value of askColor() is a tuple with two elements, both a representation of the chosen colour, e.g. ((106, 150, 98), '#6a9662') 
# The first element return[0] is a tuple (R, G, B) with the RGB representation in decimal values (from 0 to 255). The second element return[1] is a hexadecimal representation of the chosen colour. 
# If the user clicks "Cancel" the method returns the tuple (None, None). 
# 
# The optional keyword parameters are:
# color	The variable color is used to set the default colour to be displayed. If color is not set, the initial colour will be grey.
# title	The text assigned to the variable title will appear in the pop-up window's title area. The default title is "Color".
# parent	Make the pop-up window appear over window W. The default behaviour is that it appears over the root window.

# The Place geometry manager allows you explicitly set the position and size of a window, either in absolute terms, or relative to another window. The place manager can be accessed through the place method. It can be applied to all standard widgets. 
# 
# We use the place geometry manager in the following example. We are playing around with colours in this example, i.e. we assign to every label a different colour, which we randomly create using the randrange method of the random module. We calculate the brightness (grey value) of each colour. If the brightness is less than 120, we set the foreground colour (fg) of the label to White otherwise to black, so that the text can be easier read.

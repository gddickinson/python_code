#Okay, we have created Entry fields, so that the user of our program can put in some data. But how can our program access this data? How do we read the content of an Entry? 
#To put it in a nutshell: The get() method is what we are looking for. We extend our little script by two buttons "Quit" and "Show". We bind the function show_entry_fields(), which is using the get() method on the Entry objects, to the Show button. So, every time this button is clicked, the content of the Entry fields will be printed on the terminal from which we had called the script.


from Tkinter import *

def show_entry_fields():
   print("First Name: %s\nLast Name: %s" % (e1.get(), e2.get()))

master = Tk()
Label(master, text="First Name").grid(row=0)
Label(master, text="Last Name").grid(row=1)

e1 = Entry(master)
e2 = Entry(master)

e1.grid(row=0, column=1)
e2.grid(row=1, column=1)

Button(master, text='Quit', command=master.quit).grid(row=3, column=0, sticky=W, pady=4)
Button(master, text='Show', command=show_entry_fields).grid(row=3, column=1, sticky=W, pady=4)

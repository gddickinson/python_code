# Remember that after you calculate the sum of the products (of inputs and coefficients), use this formula to get the risk score:

# # Numpy and Pandas Operations
# 
# In this exercise, you will load a small dataset and compare how pandas functions and numpy functions are slightly different.  This exercise will help you when you pre-process the data in this week's assignment.

# In[ ]:


# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Import a predefined function that will generate data
from utils import load_data


# In[ ]:


# generate the features 'X' and labels 'y'
X, y = load_data(100)


# In[ ]:


# View the first few rows and column names of the features data frame
X.head()


# In[ ]:


#view the labels
y.head()


# ### How does `.mean` differ from pandas and numpy?
# 
# Even though you've likely used numpy and pandas before, it helps to pay attention to how they are slightly different in their default behaviors.
# 
# See how calculating the mean using pandas differs a bit from when calculating the mean with numpy.

# ### Pandas.DataFrame.mean
# 
# Call the .mean function of the pandas DataFrame.

# In[ ]:


# Call the .mean function of the data frame without choosing an axis
print(f"Pandas: X.mean():\n{X.mean()}")
print()
# Call the .mean function of the data frame, choosing axis=0
print(f"Pandas: X.mean(axis=0)\n{X.mean(axis=0)}")


# For pandas DataFrames:
# - By default, pandas treats each column separately.  
# - You can also explicitly instruct the function to calculate the mean for each column by setting axis=0.
# - In both cases, you get the same result.

# ### Numpy.ndarray.mean
# Compare this with what happens when you call `.mean` and the object is a numpy array.
# 
# First store the tabular data into a numpy ndarray.

# In[ ]:


# Store the data frame data into a numpy array
X_np = np.array(X)

# view the first 2 rows of the numpy array
print(f"First 2 rows of the numpy array:\n{X_np[0:2,:]}")
print()

# Call the .mean function of the numpy array without choosing an axis
print(f"Numpy.ndarray.mean: X_np.mean:\n{X_np.mean()}")
print()
# Call the .mean function of the numpy array, choosing axis=0
print(f"Numpy.ndarray.mean: X_np.mean(axis=0):\n{X_np.mean(axis=0)}")


# Notice how the default behavior of numpy.ndarray.mean differs.
# - By default, the mean is calculated for all values in the rows and columns.  You get a single mean for the entire 2D array.
# - To explicitly calculate the mean for each column separately, you can set axis=0.

# ### Question
# If you know that you want to calculate the mean for each column, how will you choose to call the .mean function if you want this to work for both pandas DataFrames and numpy arrays?

# ### This is the end of this practice section.
# 
# Please continue on with the lecture videos!
